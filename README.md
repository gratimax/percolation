# percolation

A simple project to calculate the threshold of percolation on a square grid.
See [Percolation Theory on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percolation_Theory).

## About

This project has a nice mathematical backbone and a pretty display for calculating the threshold of percolation. The
algorithm used is a simple Monte-Carlo algorithm that keeps track of possible percolation 'moves' on a lattice. On sites
are added on until the whole thing percolates.

While no extensive, accurate calculations have been run, this project consistently gets +-0.1 of the best calculations
done so far. (0.59308151 compared to 0.59274621, see
['Efficient Monte Carlo algorithm and high-precision results for percolation']
